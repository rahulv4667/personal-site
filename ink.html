                <h4>The problem and the solution</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Online classes are always recorded and streamed in traditional video format. While that is fine in many 
                    cases, this format makes it hard for people with low bandwidth to have a bufferless experience and also 
                    in the current scenario of meetings and live classes with hundreds of people in a single call, it gets 
                    very network heavy and lag between video and audio becomes an issue.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One optimisation we can do in this area is to make specialised formats for specific methodologies of teachings.
                    Even though there have been many advancements in teaching methodologies, the method of writing on board 
                    and teaching never gets old. Whether it be deep learning lectures by Andrew Ng or additions lecture by
                    convent school teacher, most people prefer using pen tool to teach even in online mode. There is no point
                    in trying to screencast every pixel of the recorded screen to all the viewers in this kind of teaching. 
                </p>
                <br>    
                <p>
                    Although efficient video coding algorithms exist to compress the video, we believe it would more efficient
                    to just stream mouse movements and events of the whiteboard instead of screenshare. While we haven't done 
                    any benchmark tests, we believe this will lessen the data to be stored for whiteboard lectures dramatically
                    and help give the best experience across all devices irrespective of the quality of stream.

                <h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whiteboard solutions aren't a new thing. Zoom supports it but the recording is still a video. 
                    Microsoft Teams supports it but has no option of recording the session yet. Although these solutions exist,
                    they work differently from how we are thinking of providing the service.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The only product that seems to be close to what we are trying to build is an Indian ed-tech startup 'Vedantu'.
                    Although they haven't revealed the internal workings of the app, we believe they are following a similar approach
                    based on the vague terms from their tech blogs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even with these solutions, we believe having a open source solution that can be plugged with any kind of
                    software in any kind of purpose wouldn't harm.

                        Create a data format(.cpx) that efficiently stores the mouse movements and events. The format must be

                        .cpx file that is present on a server or a stream URL of a live recording. This is similar to media
                        elements.

                        <span class="font-weight-bold">InkML</span>: This is an open standard for ink based streaming and 
                        recording that was last updated in 2011.
                        Most of the concepts required to build <code>chalk-pix</code> are already covered in this specification.
                        But there is no industry standard implementation that exists or to refer to and also many browsers
                        aren't supporting it natively. Even with them, the specification doesn't deal with modern
                        needs like polygon shapes, in-board images, slides etc.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="my-2">
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">MPEG DASH</span>: This shouldn't come as a surprise since 
                        <code>chalk-pix</code> deals with streaming and there is no better streaming standard currently
                        than DASH(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). While there isn't much adpative streaming needed
                        when only pen and shapes are used, there may be a requirement when in-board images and videos are 
                        used. Also, it is required to adapt audio quality if the bandwidth is too poor.
